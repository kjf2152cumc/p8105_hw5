# Introduction

This homework is associated with the Iteration Unit. This unit includes the components Writing Functions, Iteration & List columns, and Simulation.

## Library Calling

Here are all libraries used throughout this RMD: 
```{r libraries, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(rvest)
library(broom)

```

# Problem 1

## Random Function
Suppose you put n people in a room, and want to know the probability that at least two people share a birthday. For simplicity, we’ll assume there are no leap years (i.e. there are only 365 days) and that birthdays are uniformly distributed over the year (which is actually not the case).

Write a function that, for a fixed group size, randomly draws “birthdays” for each person; checks whether there are duplicate birthdays in the group; and returns TRUE or FALSE based on the result.

```{r sample}
n = 100
bday_sample = sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)

bday_sample

```

```{r function}

bday_repeats = 
  function(n = 100) {
  
    bday_sample = 
      sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
    
    has_duplicates = 
    any(duplicated(bday_sample))
  
  return(has_duplicates)
}

bday_repeats()     
bday_repeats(1)    
bday_repeats(32)  

```

## Using Function & Plotting Results
Next, run this function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and 50. For each group size, compute the probability that at least two people in the group will share a birthday by averaging across the 10000 simulation runs. Make a plot showing the probability as a function of group size, and comment on your results.

```{r}

group_n = 2:50
simulations = 10000

bday_sim_results = tibble(group_size = group_n) |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(
    probability = mean(replicate(simulations, bday_repeats(group_size)))
  ) |> 
  ungroup()

ggplot(bday_sim_results, aes(x = group_size, y = probability)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Probability of At Least Two People Sharing a Birthday",
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
**Comments on Graph:** As group size increases from n = 2 to n = 50, the probability that someone in the group shares a birthday with someone else increases. 

# Problem 2

When designing an experiment or analysis, a common question is whether it is likely that a true effect will be detected – put differently, whether a false null hypothesis will be rejected. The probability that a false null hypothesis is rejected is referred to as power, and it depends on several factors, including: the sample size; the effect size; and the error variance. In this problem, you will conduct a simulation to explore power in a one-sample t-test.

## Set Elements & Generate Datasets

Generate 5000 datasets from the model

𝑥∼𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙[𝜇,𝜎]

First set the following design elements:

Fix 𝑛=30
Fix 𝜎=5
Set 𝜇=0

For each dataset, save 𝜇̂ and the p-value arising from a test of 𝐻:𝜇=0 using 𝛼=0.05

Hint: to obtain the estimate and p-value, use broom::tidy to clean the output of t.test.

```{r}

t_simulation = 
  function(mu = 0, n = 30, sigma = 5, simulations) {
  if (!is.numeric(n) || n <= 0) stop("Sample size 'n' must be a positive number.")
  if (!is.numeric(sigma) || sigma <= 0) stop("Standard deviation 'sigma' must be a positive number.")
  if (!is.numeric(simulations) || simulations <= 0) stop("Number of simulations must be a positive number.")
  
  map_dfr(1:simulations, ~ { 
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
    test_result = t.test(x, mu = 0)
    tidy_res = tidy(test_result)
    
    tibble( 
      mu_true = mu, 
      mu_hat = tidy_res$estimate, 
      p_value = tidy_res$p.value
    )
  })
}

test_result = 
  t_simulation(mu = 0, n = 30, sigma = 5, simulations = 5000)

head(test_result)

```

## Repetitive Tasks & Plotting

Repeat the above for 𝜇={1,2,3,4,5,6}, and make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of 𝜇 on the x axis. 

```{r using function}

mu_values = 1:6

repeated = 
  map_dfr(mu_values, ~ t_simulation(.x, n=30, sigma=5, simulations=5000)) |> 
  unnest(cols = p_value)

head(repeated)
```


```{r power plot}

power_results = 
  repeated |> 
  group_by(mu_true) |> 
  summarize(power = mean(p_value < 0.05), .groups = "drop") 

power_plot = 
power_results |> 
ggplot(aes(x = mu_true, y = power)) +
  geom_point(color = "goldenrod") +
  geom_line(color = "royalblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Power of the Test vs. True Value of µ",
    x = "True Value of µ",
    y = "Power"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

power_plot

```
**Describe the association between effect size and power**: Power increases as the true mean, a proxy for effect size, increases. 

Make a plot showing the average estimate of 𝜇̂ on the y axis and the true value of 𝜇on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average estimate of 𝜇̂ only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and the true value of 𝜇 on the x axis. 

```{r}

average_results = 
  repeated |> 
  group_by(mu_true) |> 
  summarize(
    avg_mu_hat = mean(mu_hat),            
    avg_mu_hat_rejected = mean(mu_hat[p_value < 0.05])
  )

plot = 
  average_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu_true)) +
  geom_line(
    aes(y = avg_mu_hat, color = "Overall Avg µ̂"), 
            linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_line(
    aes(y = avg_mu_hat_rejected, color ="Avg µ̂ (Null   Rejected)"), size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Estimate of µ̂ vs True Value of µ",
    x = "True Value of µ",
    y = "Average Estimate of µ̂", 
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 

plot

```
**Is the sample average of 𝜇̂ across tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the true value of 𝜇? Why or why not?**


# Problem 3

The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository here. You can read their accompanying article here.

## Describe Data

Describe the raw data. Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

```{r}

```

## Function: prop.test

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe.

```{r}

```

## Run Function on Cities

Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.

```{r}

```

## Plot

Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out geom_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved homicides.

```{r}

```
